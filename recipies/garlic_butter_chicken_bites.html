    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
      <li>
        1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast (cut into 1 to 1 ½ inch pieces)
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated garlic (from about 6 garlic cloves)</li>
      <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter (cubed)</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>Chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul class="list steps">
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk together flour, salt, Italian seasoning, and granulated garlic in
        a medium bowl until evenly combined; add chicken and toss until evenly
        coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high until just
        shimmering. Add coated chicken pieces in an even layer; cook,
        undisturbed, until browned on one side, about 4 minutes. Flip chicken
        and cook until browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes more.
        Transfer chicken to a clean plate; wipe skillet clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium. Add garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until
        fragrant and slightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in wine and cook,
        stirring often, until the majority of the wine has evaporated, about 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add butter and lemon juice; cook, stirring, until butter is fully
        melted, about 1 more minute. Add chicken back to skillet and toss in
        butter mixture until evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer to a serving platter and garnish with parsley.</li>
    </ul>
